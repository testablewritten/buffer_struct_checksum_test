# save struct on buffer and extract and test checksum value

* run the code with __compile_and_run_and_delete_compiled.sh__

## how to use

* __main.cpp__ has save and extract struct on buffer with printing out checksum values

* __main.py__ only checks the checksum of struct which has same structure defined on __main.cpp__

* both __main.cpp__ and __main.py__ should show the same digit for same struct member variable values
